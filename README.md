# A Meta Analysis on Childrenâ€™s Trust in Social Robots. 
(Rebecca Stower &amp; Natalia Calvo-Barajas &amp; Ginevra Castellano &amp; Arvid Kappas)

This repository contains the a set of R scripts to run a Multivariate Mixed-Effect Meta-Analytic Regression Model for Meta Analysis on Children's Trust in Social Robots, but also the information about the studies and methods used for data-extraction. 

| File Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| main_Meta-Analysis-Trust-cHRI.R | Main script containing the four mixed-effects meta-analytic models |
| MRE_model.R | Multivarite model, univariate model, moderator analysis |
| correlation.R | Imputed correlations |
| effectsizes_variance.R | Computing effect sizes estimates (Cohen's d) based on means, SDs, t-value, and F-values |
| heterogeneity.R | Heterogeneity analysis |
| visualizations.R | Meta-Analytic visualizations |
| MetaAnalysis_Trust_cHRI | Collection of studies related to this research, methods, selection criteria, coding book for data extraction.|

*Note 1: We follow the methodology proposed by Standford Metalab to calculate the effect sizes estimates based on the experimental design, variance, and data extration. Please check the MetaLab repository for more details.* </br>
